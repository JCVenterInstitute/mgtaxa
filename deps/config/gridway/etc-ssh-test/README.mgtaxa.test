This is a test config for GridWay with SSH MAD.
Copy the files from this directory to $GW_LOCATION/etc
(you will overwrite existing gwd.conf).
If you want to run several gwd instances on the same host (such as
development testing under different accounts), you need to
set the PORT in etc/gwd.conf to a unique value. Make sure that you
the file gridway/var/gwd.port reflects your new port value after you
restarted the gwd (it does not remove that file when you terminate it).
Modify the SSH host name if needed.
Make sure you can ssh to that host from the command line
w/o problems or password prompts.
To start GW daemon, type 'gwd'.
'gwhost' to see that MAD host data is loaded from info-MAD
To stop GW daemon, type 'pkill gwd'
To submit job from the command line w/o waiting for it to run, 
use 'gwsubmit -t job_template_file.jt'
To see the status of job, use 'gwps'
The job logs are under $GW_LOCATION/var/xxx where xxx is the GW job ID
GW daemon logs are under $GW_LOCATION/var
If a job gets stuck in 'prolog' state, modify the SSH transport MAD by
removing a separate thread for ssh connection. That will make ssh module
exceptions visible. Modify the MAD code to log the full MAD protocol strings,
and test MAD from the command line directly by copying the strings generated
by GridWay as saved in MAD log.
