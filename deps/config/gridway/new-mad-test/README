This configures a new MAD, created as a renamed copy
of SSH MAD.
Installation:
1. pkill gwd
1. Copy subdirectories into GW_LOCATION, overwriting existing files
2. Remove all job directories under GW_LOCATION/var, otherwise your
new jobs will be stuck in 'pending' state because GW cannot load
MADs (why it tries to load them) for previous jobs, because the new
config removes references to previous MADs (such as SSH MADs)
3. gwd
The tests that ran with SSH MADS should run unchanged with this 
"new" MAD. The new MADs config renames evrything 'ssh' into 
'lrm_proxy'.
