This package is a modified clone of the SimpleMake subdirectory
of the Glimmer3 package as obtained from the source code distribution
of the Phymm package.
Our primary goal was to use the Interpolated Context Models (ICMs) for taxonomic
classification of the metagenomic sequences, following in the Phymm
footsteps. To that end, we made some modifications in the original
Glimmer3 source files (see CHANGELOG and corresponding files).
Our build procedure, based on Cmake, creates executables with a prefix "mgt-glm-"
to avoide confusion with the original Glimmer executables. A library is also
created, with a simple API, to facilitate training and classification with ICMs
from external code without creating a subprocess for ICM executables.
See COPYING document for use and re-distribution terms conforming with the 
original Glimmer3 license.
